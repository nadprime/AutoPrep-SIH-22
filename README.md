"Every Machine Learning task requires structured data. It is the basic need to proceed with training and testing. The importance of structured data can be seen from the fact that models cannot be trained on unstructured data. Hence, it is a vital task in any machine learning, deep learning/AI problem. Raw data can correspond to any thing – text, images…. Labelling the data/structuring it requires precision as failure in doing so will result in wrong labels thus wrong results. Labelling the data/structuring the data is the most painful aspect for any machine learning engineer, automating this will solve a huge problem.There is a requirement of a an automation tool(Web,App,Standalone tool) which takes as input the unstructured data and as output generates the structured data. The below questions are the direct requirements to be fulfilled as part of the solution. 1. How can we convert, say 95% of unstructured data without any standard to structured data with standard through automated tool? 2. How can we have low code / no code solution in open source to prepare AI ready data? For example, there can be a python based tool which is a standalone tool, which takes as input the raw data and based upon users requirements, generates the structured data."
